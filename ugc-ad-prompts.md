## Prompt 1 – Dry Skin Relief UGC Ad

### Prompt Strategy:
This prompt is designed to generate a short, relatable UGC-style advertisement script. 
The goal is to make the AI sound like a real user sharing a personal skincare experience, including a hook, problem, solution, and call-to-action.

**Prompt:**
Act as a real skincare user creating a short Instagram Reel style video script. 
The product is “GlowUp Skincare Cream” that helps with dull and dry skin, giving a natural glow. 
The tone should be friendly, honest, and personal — like you are talking to your followers. 
Start with a strong hook, describe the skin problem, explain how the product helped, and end with a call to action. 
Keep it under 20 seconds speaking time.

**AI Output:**
Hook:
“Why is my skin glowing all of a sudden?!”

Script:
I used to struggle with dry, dull skin that always looked tired no matter what I tried. Two weeks ago, I started using GlowUp Skincare Cream, and I can honestly see the difference. My skin feels more hydrated, softer, and it has this natural glow without feeling greasy. It’s super lightweight and absorbs really fast too.
